# Bountied WhistleBlowing Project with zkEmail & Circom

## [Section 1] Project Information
- Project Name: Bountied WhistleBlowing Project with zkEmail & Circom
- Payment Details: 0x0ed18cFf1e16Db3f8b76D05c84182E4849ab03D4
- Total Amount Requested: 15,000 USDC

## [Section 2] Project Overview :page_facing_up:
- Brief Description:
This project aims to create a secure, anonymous platform for whistleblowers using zkEmail and Circom technologies. It addresses the critical need for privacy and security in whistleblowing, potentially revolutionizing investigative journalism and corporate accountability. The project leverages zero-knowledge proofs to ensure whistleblowers can share information without fear of identification or retaliation.

- Core Idea:
The core innovation is the integration of zkEmail verification and Circom circuits to create a bounty platform for leaks. Key components include a ZK Email Verifier, regex confirmation of document keywords, and an escrow system for secure transactions. This architecture ensures user privacy while facilitating a marketplace for sensitive information.

- Technology Stack:
  - Frontend: Next.js
  - Backend: Node.js with Express
  - Authentication: Auth0/Firebase
  - Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL, MongoDB
  - Caching: Redis
  - Search Engine: Elasticsearch/Algolia
  - Blockchain: Ethereum (for smart contracts)
  - ZK Proofs: Circom (ported from Circom)
  - Cryptography: RSA, SHA
  - Privacy Layer: polygon Network


## [Section 3] Ecosystem Fit
- Similar Projects:
While there are existing whistleblowing platforms, this project uniquely combines zero-knowledge proofs, blockchain technology, and financial incentives to create a secure and efficient marketplace for sensitive information.

- Unique Contribution:
This project brings enhanced privacy and security to whistleblowing through zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technology. It addresses critical issues in existing platforms while creating financial incentives for high-quality information, potentially setting a new standard for secure information exchange in journalism and corporate compliance.
